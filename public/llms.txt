> A structured approach to managing risk in delegation relationships, with applications to AI safety. The framework proposes structural constraints (decomposition, least-X principles, risk budgeting) to bound potential harm regardless of delegate behavior.

The core idea: **Safety can be architectural, not just behavioral.** Instead of one powerful delegate, decompose tasks across many limited components. Budget delegation risk like money: Delegation Risk = Σ P(harm) × Damage. Whether this works in practice depends on implementation details, but the underlying principle has proven useful across domains.
