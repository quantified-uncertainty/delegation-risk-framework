# Experimental

This section contains experimental features, tools, and methodologies that are under active development. These are promising approaches that haven't yet been fully validated or integrated into the core framework.

## What's Here

### [Probabilistic Estimation](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/)

A comprehensive system for quantifying delegation risk using probability distributions rather than point estimates. Includes:

- **Interactive Tools**: Monte Carlo simulators, Bayesian trust updaters, sensitivity analyzers
- **Estimates Registry**: Calibrated priors for failure probabilities, damage distributions, and mitigation effectiveness
- **Methodological Guides**: Expert elicitation protocols, incident database integration

## Using Experimental Features

These features are:
- **Functional** but may have rough edges
- **Subject to change** based on feedback and testing
- **Not yet validated** against real-world deployments

We encourage experimentation and welcome feedback on what works and what doesn't.

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping develop these experimental features:
1. Try them out on your own risk assessments
2. Report issues or suggestions via GitHub
3. Share calibration data if you have it
4. Propose improvements or new tools
