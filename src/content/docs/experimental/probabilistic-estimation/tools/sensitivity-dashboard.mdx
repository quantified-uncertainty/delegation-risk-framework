# Sensitivity Dashboard

This tool helps you identify **which parameters matter most** for your risk profile, enabling focused optimization efforts.

## Why Sensitivity Analysis?

Risk models have many parameters. Not all are equally important:

- Some parameters have wide uncertainty but low impact
- Others have narrow ranges but dominate the outcome
- Knowing which is which helps prioritize investigation and mitigation

## Understanding the Outputs

### Tornado Diagram

The tornado diagram shows **one-at-a-time sensitivity**:
- Each bar represents one parameter varying from min to max
- Center line is the base case risk
- Longer bars = more influential parameters
- Parameters sorted by influence (most important at top)

### Elasticity

Elasticity measures **relative sensitivity**:

```
Elasticity = (% change in risk) / (% change in parameter)
```

| Elasticity | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|
| > 1.0 | Risk more than proportional to parameter |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Moderate sensitivity |
| 0.2 - 0.5 | Low sensitivity |
| < 0.2 | Negligible impact |

### Top Drivers

The top 3 parameters that most influence your total risk. Focus investigation and mitigation here first.

## How to Use This Tool

### 1. Customize Parameters
Adjust the base values and ranges to match your specific situation. The sensitivity analysis will recalculate automatically.

### 2. Identify High-Impact Areas
Look for parameters with:
- Long bars in the tornado diagram
- High absolute elasticity values
- Wide possible ranges

### 3. Prioritize Actions

For **high-sensitivity parameters with uncertainty**:
- Invest in better estimates (data collection, expert elicitation)
- Consider robust decision-making approaches

For **high-sensitivity parameters you can control**:
- Prioritize mitigation investments here
- Calculate ROI of reducing the parameter

For **low-sensitivity parameters**:
- Don't over-invest in precise estimates
- Simple approximations are often sufficient

## Limitations

### One-at-a-Time Analysis

This dashboard uses one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis:
- Varies each parameter while holding others constant
- Doesn't capture interaction effects between parameters
- May underestimate total uncertainty from correlated parameters

### Linear Approximation

Elasticities assume approximately linear relationships:
- Actual risk functions may be highly nonlinear
- Extreme parameter values may have disproportionate effects

### Range Dependence

Results depend heavily on assumed parameter ranges:
- Wide ranges will show high importance
- Narrow ranges will appear less important
- Choose ranges that reflect actual uncertainty

## Advanced: Monte Carlo Sensitivity

For more accurate sensitivity analysis, use the [Risk Calculator](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/tools/risk-calculator) with parameter variations:

1. Run baseline simulation
2. Vary one parameter's distribution
3. Compare output distributions
4. Repeat for each parameter

This captures nonlinear effects and parameter correlations better than OAT analysis.
