# Risk Calculator

This tool calculates your **expected monthly delegation risk** using Monte Carlo simulation with probabilistic inputs.

## How It Works

1. **Define Harm Modes**: Each potential failure mode has a probability of occurring and an associated damage distribution
2. **Probabilistic Modeling**: Probabilities use beta distributions; damages use lognormal distributions to capture uncertainty
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 10,000 scenarios are sampled to build the risk distribution
4. **Budget Analysis**: Compare your risk tolerance against the simulated distribution

## Understanding the Inputs

### Probability (mean)
The expected probability that this harm mode occurs each month. For example:
- 0.05 = 5% chance of occurring
- 0.01 = 1% chance of occurring

### Probability (uncertainty)
How confident you are in the probability estimate. Higher values create wider distributions around the mean.

### Damage (median $)
The typical cost when this harm mode occurs. Uses lognormal distribution, so actual damages could be significantly higher.

### Damage (log-std)
Controls the "tail thickness" of the damage distribution:
- 0.5 = relatively predictable damages
- 1.0 = moderate variation
- 1.5 = high variation (rare events could be much larger)

## Understanding the Outputs

### Budget Confidence
The probability that your actual monthly risk stays within budget. Target levels:
- **90%+**: Conservative, suitable for risk-averse organizations
- **70-90%**: Moderate, typical for most applications
- **Below 70%**: Aggressive, may need risk reduction measures

### Expected Risk vs. Median
- **Expected (mean)**: Average of all simulations. Pulled up by tail events.
- **Median**: Middle value. More representative of "typical" month.

If expected is much greater than median, you have significant tail risk.

### 5th and 95th Percentiles
- **5th percentile**: Best-case realistic scenario
- **95th percentile**: Worst-case realistic scenario (1-in-20 months)

## Recommended Priors

Use these starting points based on component type:

| Component Type | Probability Prior | Damage Prior |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Deterministic code | beta(1, 100) ~1% | lognormal(log(100), 0.5) |
| Narrow ML | beta(3, 100) ~3% | lognormal(log(500), 0.7) |
| General LLM | beta(8, 80) ~10% | lognormal(log(1000), 0.9) |
| RL/Agentic | beta(15, 60) ~20% | lognormal(log(2000), 1.1) |

See [Probability Priors](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/estimates/probability-priors) for detailed distributions.

## Tips for Better Estimates

1. **Start conservative**: Underestimating risk is worse than overestimating
2. **Use reference classes**: How did similar systems perform historically?
3. **Decompose carefully**: More specific harm modes are easier to estimate
4. **Update with data**: Use the [Trust Updater](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/tools/trust-updater) as you gather track record
5. **Sensitivity check**: Which inputs matter most? See [Sensitivity Dashboard](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/tools/sensitivity-dashboard)
