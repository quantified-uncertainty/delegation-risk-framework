# Trust Updater

This tool helps you convert **observed track records** into **calibrated trust estimates** using Bayesian updating.

## Why Bayesian Updating?

Simple success rate calculations ignore:
- **Prior knowledge**: What you believed before observations
- **Sample size**: 9/10 is not the same as 900/1000
- **Uncertainty**: Confidence should increase with more data

Bayesian updating properly weighs prior beliefs against observed evidence.

## How It Works

### 1. Prior Selection

Your prior belief encodes what you expect before seeing any data. The framework provides defaults:

| Component Type | Prior | Mean Reliability |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| Deterministic Code | beta(99, 1) | 99% |
| Narrow ML | beta(19, 1) | 95% |
| General LLM | beta(9, 1) | 90% |
| RL/Agentic | beta(4, 1) | 80% |
| Skeptical | beta(5, 5) | 50% |

### 2. Observations

Enter the number of successes and failures you've observed. More observations will move the posterior further from the prior.

### 3. Posterior Belief

The updated belief after combining prior with observations:

```
posterior = beta(prior_alpha + successes, prior_beta + failures)
```

### 4. Track Record Modifier

The modifier adjusts your risk estimate based on performance vs. expectations:

```
modifier = prior_mean / posterior_mean
```

- **< 1.0**: Performance better than expected, reduce risk
- **= 1.0**: Performance matches expectation, no change
- **> 1.0**: Performance worse than expected, increase risk

## Interpretation Guide

### Confidence Interval Width

The 90% CI width indicates your uncertainty:

| CI Width | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| < 5% | High confidence, stable estimate |
| 5-15% | Moderate confidence |
| 15-30% | Low confidence, need more data |
| > 30% | Very uncertain, prior dominates |

### Data Requirements

How much data to significantly update from prior:

| Prior Strength | Observations Needed |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Weak (alpha + beta ≈ 10) | 20-50 |
| Moderate (alpha + beta ≈ 50) | 100-200 |
| Strong (alpha + beta ≈ 200) | 500+ |

## Best Practices

### Starting a New Component
1. Start with the appropriate component-type prior
2. Use a weak prior strength to allow quick updates
3. Closely monitor first 50-100 tasks
4. Increase prior strength as track record accumulates

### Established Components
1. Use a moderate prior based on historical volume
2. Apply time-weighting (recent observations count more)
3. Weight complex tasks higher than simple ones
4. Review calibration quarterly

### Critical Components
1. Use a skeptical prior (trust must be earned)
2. Weight adversarial failures heavily (3× normal failures)
3. Focus on worst-case bounds, not just mean
4. Require statistical significance before increasing trust

## Integration with Risk Calculator

The track record modifier feeds directly into the [Risk Calculator](/experimental/probabilistic-estimation/tools/risk-calculator):

```squiggle
// Base risk from component type
baseRisk = probability * damage

// Adjusted for track record
adjustedRisk = baseRisk * trackRecordModifier
```

Good track records reduce risk; poor track records increase it.
