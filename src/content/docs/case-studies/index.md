description: Real-world examples showing delegation risk principles in action across AI systems and human organizations.
---

This section contains concrete examples—both successes and failures—that illustrate how delegation risk principles apply in practice.

## AI System Case Studies

Direct applications to AI systems, from failures to successes:

| Case | Outcome | Key Lesson |
|------|---------|------------|
| [Sydney (Failure)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-sydney/) | Acute failure | What happens when constraints are missing |
| [Code Review Bot (Success)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-success/) | 8 months in production | Sustained success through proper design |
| [Support Bot (Near-Miss)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-near-miss/) | $50K error caught | Verification layers save the day |
| [Content Moderator (Drift)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-drift/) | Gradual degradation | How small changes compound |
| [Anti-Patterns](/case-studies/ai-systems/anti-patterns/) | Common mistakes | What not to do |

## Human System Case Studies

Delegation risk principles aren't new—human organizations have developed sophisticated approaches:

| Case | Domain | Key Insight |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [Alliance Cascades](/case-studies/human-systems/alliance-cascades/) | Geopolitics | Hidden alliances create systemic risk (WW1) |
| [Criminal Organizations](/case-studies/human-systems/criminal-trust/) | Illegal enterprises | Trust without legal enforcement |
| [Organizational Trust](/case-studies/human-systems/organizational-trust/) | Corporate hierarchies | Formal delegation structures |
| [Jury Systems](/case-studies/human-systems/jury-trust/) | Legal system | Adversarial trust filtering |
| [Nuclear Launch Authority](/case-studies/human-systems/nuclear-launch-authority/) | Military | Extreme consequence management |
| [Open Source Communities](/case-studies/human-systems/open-source-trust/) | Software | Distributed trust at scale |
| [Cross-Civilization Trust](/case-studies/human-systems/trust-across-civilizations/) | Historical | Trust across vast differences |
| [The Oversight Dilemma](/case-studies/human-systems/oversight-dilemma/) | Governance | Who watches the watchers? |

## Power, Agency, and Authority Case Studies

Analysis of real systems through the lens of [agency and power formalization](/power-dynamics/agent-power-formalization/):

| Case | Power | Agency | Key Insight |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| [Central Banks](/case-studies/power-dynamics-cases/#case-study-1-central-banks) | Very High | Low | Institutional constraints limit agency despite high power |
| [Recommendation Algorithms](/case-studies/power-dynamics-cases/#case-study-2-recommendation-algorithms) | High | Medium | Optimization creates emergent agency |
| [AlphaFold](/case-studies/power-dynamics-cases/#case-study-3-alphafold) | High | Very Low | Strong tools are achievable in narrow domains |
| [Corporate Boards](/case-studies/power-dynamics-cases/#case-study-4-corporate-boards) | High | Medium | Structural constraints substitute for alignment |
| [Self-Driving Cars](/case-studies/power-dynamics-cases/#case-study-5-self-driving-cars) | Medium | Medium | Bounded agency through hard constraints |

## The Anomaly Chronicles

:::note[Fiction]
The Anomaly Chronicles is **speculative fiction**, not a case study of real events. It explores how delegation principles might apply to hypothetical extreme scenarios.
:::

A narrative exploration of delegation risk principles scaled to extreme scenarios:

| Chapter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [Introduction](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/) | Setting and premise |
| [Containing Mr. X](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/containing-mr-x/) | Original containment engagement |
| [Mr. X: A Perspective](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/mr-x-perspective/) | The agent's viewpoint |
| [Power Struggles](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/power-struggles/) | Multi-agent coordination |
| [Task Architecture](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/task-architecture/) | Structural approaches |
| [Five Years Later](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/five-years-later/) | System evolution |
| [Year Ten](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/year-ten/) | Long-term dynamics |

## Reading Suggestions

### New to the Framework
Start with the AI system cases—they're most directly applicable:
1. [Sydney (Failure)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-sydney/) — See what goes wrong
2. [Code Review Bot (Success)](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-success/) — See what goes right
3. [Anti-Patterns](/case-studies/ai-systems/anti-patterns/) — Learn what to avoid

### Looking for Inspiration
The human systems cases show established approaches (with varying track records):
1. [Nuclear Launch Authority](/case-studies/human-systems/nuclear-launch-authority/) — Extreme stakes
2. [Criminal Organizations](/case-studies/human-systems/criminal-trust/) — Trust without enforcement
3. [Open Source Communities](/case-studies/human-systems/open-source-trust/) — Distributed trust

### Want the Full Picture
The Anomaly Chronicles explores where these principles lead at scale:
1. Start with [The Insurer's Dilemma](/delegation-risk/insurers-dilemma/) for context
2. Then read the Chronicles in order

## How Case Studies Connect to Principles

| Principle | Best Illustrated By |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Least Capability | [Sydney](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-sydney/) (violation), [Code Review Bot](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-success/) (success) |
| Verification Layers | [Near-Miss](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-near-miss/) (saved by verification) |
| Trust Decay | [Drift](/case-studies/ai-systems/case-study-drift/) (gradual failure) |
| Adversarial Oversight | [Jury Systems](/case-studies/human-systems/jury-trust/), [Oversight Dilemma](/case-studies/human-systems/oversight-dilemma/) |
| Bounded Exposure | [Nuclear Launch](/case-studies/human-systems/nuclear-launch-authority/), [Anomaly Chronicles](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/) |
