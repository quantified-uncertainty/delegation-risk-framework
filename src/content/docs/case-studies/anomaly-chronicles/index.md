# The Anomaly Chronicles

:::note[Narrative Documentation]
This section tells the story of the Anomaly Unit—a fictional case study exploring how delegation risk principles scale to extreme scenarios. It follows the development from Year 1 through Year 10 of a system designed to safely engage entities that are smarter, more capable, and potentially adversarial.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, read [The Insurer's Dilemma](/delegation-risk/insurers-dilemma/) — it establishes Diana's insurance framework and moral hazard concepts that underpin the anomaly engagement system.

## Reading Order

The narrative follows chronologically:

1. **[Managing Exposure in Power Delegation](./power-struggles/)** — Foundation: how power delegation creates exposure
2. **[Containing Mr. X](./containing-mr-x/)** — Year 1: The first anomaly engagement
3. **[Five Years Later](./five-years-later/)** — Years 2-5: The marketplace emerges
4. **[Task Architecture](./task-architecture/)** — Deep dive: information-minimal execution, spawning, blind delegation
5. **[Year Ten](./year-ten/)** — Years 6-10: The new equilibrium
6. **[Mr. X: A Perspective](./mr-x-perspective/)** — Appendix: An anomaly's view
