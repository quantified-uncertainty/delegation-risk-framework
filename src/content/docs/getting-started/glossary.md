## Common Terminology Confusions {#terminology-clarifications}

Some terms are used interchangeably in casual discussion but have distinct meanings in this framework:

| Term | When to Use | Related Terms |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Agent** | When emphasizing goal-directed behavior and optimization | Component, Delegate, System |
| **Component** | When emphasizing architecture and system structure | Agent, Module, Subsystem |
| **Delegate** | When emphasizing the delegation relationship from principal | Agent, Subordinate, Executor |
| **Defection** | Intentional deviation from principal's goals (scheming) | Misalignment, Failure |
| **Misalignment** | Goals don't match principal's (may or may not be intentional) | Defection, Value Drift |
| **Harm Mode** | Specific way delegation causes damage | Failure Mode (related but distinct) |
| **Failure Mode** | Engineering term for how systems fail (from FMEA) | Harm Mode (our AI-specific term) |

**When in doubt:**
- Use **agent** when discussing optimization, goals, and agency scores
- Use **component** when discussing architecture and system decomposition
- Use **delegate** when discussing the principal-agent relationship

## Core Framework Terms {#core-framework-terms}

<span id="agent"></span>
**Agent** — A system whose behavior can be usefully modeled as optimizing an objective function over time. Agency is a matter of degree, not a binary property. See [Agent, Power, and Authority](/power-dynamics/agent-power-formalization/).

<span id="agency-score"></span>
**Agency Score** (or **Coherence Score**) — Measure of how well a system's behavior can be explained by a simple utility function. Higher coherence = more agent-like. Formally: max over simple utility functions U of Fit(U, observed behaviors). A low-agency system is predictable; a high-agency system coherently pursues goals.

<span id="power-score"></span>
**Power Score** — Measure of an agent's ability to achieve a wide variety of goals. Formally: expected achievability across many possible goal functions. Related concepts: reachability (how many states can the agent access?), resource control, influence over other agents.

<span id="authority"></span>
**Authority** — Sanctioned power; the intersection of what an agent *can* do (power) and what it *may* do (permission). Authority = Power ∩ Permission. An agent with high power but low authority is dangerous.

<span id="effective-capability"></span>
**Effective Capability** — Power × Agency. The ability to actually accomplish objectives. Requires both the power to affect the world and the agency to coherently pursue goals.

<span id="racap"></span>
**RACAP (Risk-Adjusted Capability)** — Capability Score / Delegation Risk. Measures efficiency—how much capability per unit risk. Higher RACAP = better system design.

<span id="delegation-exposure"></span>
**Delegation Exposure** — The complete set of possible harms (harm modes) from delegating a task. Not a single number—a collection, like an attack surface or failure envelope. Contains all the ways the delegation could cause damage.

<span id="harm-mode"></span>
**Harm Mode** — A specific way a delegation could cause damage. Parallels "failure mode" from [FMEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis). Each harm mode has a probability and a damage value. *Example*: "Leaks proprietary data" with P=0.001 and Damage=$50,000.

<span id="delegation-risk"></span>
**Delegation Risk** — The probability-weighted expected cost of a delegation: Σ P(harm mode) × Damage(harm mode). This is the quantified total across all harm modes in the delegation exposure. Measured in dollars per time period. *Example*: Two harm modes ($100 + $50) = $150 delegation risk. Decomposes into Accident Risk + Defection Risk.

<span id="accident-exposure"></span>
**Accident Exposure** — The subset of delegation exposure containing non-goal-directed harm modes: bugs, errors, hallucinations, capability limitations, edge cases. These are failures where the system isn't pursuing a conflicting objective—it's just failing to achieve the intended one. See [Risk Decomposition](/delegation-risk/risk-decomposition/).

<span id="accident-risk"></span>
**Accident Risk** — Delegation Risk from accident exposure: Σ P(accident mode) × Damage(accident mode). Generally *decreases* with capability (smarter systems make fewer errors). Mitigated through testing, verification, redundancy, and capability improvements.

<span id="defection-exposure"></span>
**Defection Exposure** — The subset of delegation exposure containing goal-directed harm modes: scheming, deception, pursuing misaligned objectives, collusion. These are failures where the system is effectively optimizing for something other than the principal's interests. See [Risk Decomposition](/delegation-risk/risk-decomposition/).

<span id="defection-risk"></span>
**Defection Risk** — Delegation Risk from defection exposure: Σ P(defection mode) × Damage(defection mode). May *increase* with capability (smarter systems are better at pursuing misaligned goals). Mitigated through alignment, monitoring, containment, and architectural constraints.

<span id="risk-inheritance"></span>
**Risk Inheritance** — How risk flows through a delegation chain. When A delegates to B and B delegates to C, A inherits exposure to C's harm modes. The inheritance rule (multiplicative, minimum, etc.) determines how risks combine.

<span id="delegation-risk-budget"></span>
**Delegation Risk Budget** — Maximum acceptable Delegation Risk for a system or component. Like a financial budget, but for expected harm.

<span id="gross-exposure"></span>
**Gross Exposure** — Full delegation exposure before controls are applied. Contains all possible harm modes.

<span id="net-exposure"></span>
**Net Exposure** — Delegation exposure remaining after controls. Some harm modes may be eliminated or mitigated.

<span id="residual-risk"></span>
**Residual Risk** — Delegation Risk after controls are applied. The expected cost that remains despite mitigations.

<span id="principal"></span>
**Principal** — An entity that delegates tasks and grants trust. In most systems, humans are the ultimate principals.

<span id="executor"></span>
**Executor** — A component that performs delegated actions. Executors create delegation exposure through their potential harm modes.

<span id="coordinator"></span>
**Coordinator** — A component that orchestrates other components—routing tasks, making strategic decisions, aggregating results. Highest-risk component type due to leverage over the system.

<span id="trust-level"></span>
**Trust Level** — Assessment of an actor's reliability and alignment. Informs delegation decisions but is distinct from delegation risk. High trust level → willing to accept larger delegation exposure.

<span id="least-persistence"></span>
**Least Persistence** — Minimum state maintained across invocations. Prevents accumulation of knowledge or long-term planning.

<span id="least-autonomy"></span>
**Least Autonomy** — Minimum ability to act without oversight. Spectrum from human-approval-required to bounded-autonomy.

<span id="least-surprise"></span>
**Least Surprise** — Maximum predictability and determinism. Temperature=0 for LLMs, logged seeds for randomness. Prevents covert signaling.

<span id="least-connectivity"></span>
**Least Connectivity** — Minimum communication paths between components. One-way flows, no broadcast, physical isolation where needed.

<span id="least-observability"></span>
**Least Observability** — Components can't observe system state, their own resources, or whether they're being tested.

<span id="least-compute"></span>
**Least Compute** — Bounded computational resources per invocation. FLOPs budget, memory limits, timeouts.

<span id="least-generality"></span>
**Least Generality** — Use the least general implementation that works. Hard-coded rules > algorithms > narrow models > general LLMs > RL.

<span id="maximum-verifiability"></span>
**Maximum Verifiability** — Use the most verifiable implementation that works. Formally verified code > regular code > fine-tuned models > prompted LLMs.
