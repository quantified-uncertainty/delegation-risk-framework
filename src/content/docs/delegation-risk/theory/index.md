# Theoretical Foundations

:::note[Theoretical Content]
These documents explore the mathematical and economic foundations of trust and delegation. They provide formal frameworks that underpin the practical applications in other sections.

## Relationship to Practice

These theoretical foundations inform:

- **Protocol multipliers** in the [Protocol Catalog](/delegation-risk/reference/protocol-catalog/)
- **Track record calculations** in the [Insurance Bot](/delegation-risk/reference/insurance-bot-spec/)
- **Exposure modeling** in [Delegation Accounting](/delegation-risk/delegation-accounting/)
