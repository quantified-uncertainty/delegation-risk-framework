# Delegation Accounting in Power Struggles

:::note[TL;DR]
Power struggles are delegation problems. Every agent in a hierarchy constantly evaluates whether loyalty or defection has higher expected value. Oversight works by raising the contingent liability of defection. Constitutional design, corporate governance, and dictatorial control are all forms of balance sheet engineering.
:::

This document applies the delegation accounting framework to political and organizational power struggles. The core insight: **power grabs happen when the "defect" option becomes more valuable than the "loyal" option.**

---

## The Framework Recap

Every delegation creates a balance sheet for the delegate:

**Option A: Execute Faithfully**
| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** | Compensation, status, future opportunities |
| **Exposure** | Accidental failures, being blamed unfairly |
| **Net Value** | Usually positive |

**Option B: Defect**
| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** | Power, wealth, autonomy gained through defection |
| **Contingent Liability** | Probability of failure × consequences |
| **Net Value** | Depends on oversight strength |

**The critical question**: When does Net Value(Defect) > Net Value(Loyal)?

---

## Part 1: Corporate Governance

### 1.1 Board vs CEO

A corporation's board delegates operational control to the CEO. The CEO receives authority over billions in assets, thousands of employees, and strategic direction.

**CEO's Balance Sheet: Execute Faithfully**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary, bonus, equity) | $15M/year |
| **Receivable** (reputation, future boards) | $20M NPV |
| **Exposure** (fired for bad luck, market downturn) | -$5M |
| **Net Value** | **$30M** |

**CEO's Balance Sheet: Extract Value**

Extraction takes many forms: excessive compensation, empire-building acquisitions, related-party transactions, golden parachutes, or simply optimizing for short-term stock price to cash out options.

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (extraction value) | $100M |
| **Contingent Liability** (40% caught: fired, clawbacks, reputation) | -$30M |
| **Net Value** | **$70M** |

In this example, extraction wins. The CEO rationally defects.

#### What Changes the Calculation?

**Stronger oversight (raises contingent liability):**
- Independent board members with real power
- Clawback provisions in compensation
- Active institutional shareholders
- Regulatory enforcement (SEC, DOJ)
- Media scrutiny

**Weaker oversight (lowers contingent liability):**
- Board captured by CEO (CEO picks directors)
- Dispersed shareholders with no coordination
- Complex corporate structures hiding extraction
- Weak enforcement environment
- "Too big to jail" dynamics

#### Real-World Close Calls

**Enron (2001)**: CEO balance sheet heavily favored extraction. Board oversight was minimal, auditors were compromised, and complex SPVs hid the defection. Contingent liability appeared near zero until it wasn't.

**WeWork (2019)**: Adam Neumann's balance sheet: massive receivables from self-dealing (leasing buildings to WeWork, trademark licensing), low contingent liability (controlled board through super-voting shares). Only the failed IPO raised contingent liability enough to force removal.

**Disney (2004)**: Michael Eisner faced a 43% withhold vote on his board seat. Shareholders coordinated to raise contingent liability. He lost the chairmanship. Example of oversight working.

---

### 1.2 Shareholders vs Board

The delegation chain extends further: shareholders delegate to the board.

**Board Member's Balance Sheet: Faithful Oversight**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (director fees) | $300K/year |
| **Receivable** (reputation, other board seats) | $2M NPV |
| **Exposure** (sued for breach of duty) | -$200K (D&O insurance covers most) |
| **Net Value** | **$2.1M** |

**Board Member's Balance Sheet: Rubber-Stamp Management**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (fees, easy job, CEO's goodwill) | $350K/year + future seats |
| **Contingent Liability** (15% major scandal, sued, reputation destroyed) | -$1M |
| **Net Value** | **$2.5M** |

The numbers often favor rubber-stamping. Director liability is limited, D&O insurance covers most exposure, and challenging management risks losing the seat.

#### The Caremark Problem

Delaware's *Caremark* standard requires boards to monitor for legal compliance. But the standard is weak—liability only attaches for "utter failure" to implement controls or "conscious disregard" of red flags.

| Oversight Level | Board Effort | Contingent Liability |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Utter failure | Zero | Liability possible |
| Minimal compliance | Low | Liability nearly impossible |
| Active oversight | High | Liability nearly impossible |

The jump from "minimal" to "active" has the same contingent liability but much higher cost. Rational boards do the minimum.

#### Real-World Applications

**Boeing 737 MAX (2018-2019)**: Board had minimal aerospace expertise, delegated heavily to management. Red flags existed but weren't elevated. When crashes occurred, board faced lawsuits, but D&O insurance and settlements limited personal exposure. Contingent liability was low even after catastrophe.

**Theranos**: Board included Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and other luminaries. None had relevant expertise. They provided legitimacy in exchange for fees and status. When fraud was exposed, reputational damage was significant but financial liability limited.

---

### 1.3 The Full Corporate Chain

```
Shareholders → Board → CEO → Executives → Managers → Employees
```

Each link has its own balance sheet. Each agent evaluates loyalty vs. defection.

| Level | Primary "Defection" Mode | Typical Contingent Liability |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Board | Rubber-stamp management | Low (limited liability, insurance) |
| CEO | Value extraction | Medium (firing, clawbacks, reputation) |
| Executive | Empire-building, information hiding | Medium (career risk) |
| Manager | Inflate metrics, hide problems | Low-Medium (firing) |
| Employee | Slack, theft, sabotage | Low (firing, rarely prosecuted) |

**Key insight**: Contingent liability tends to be highest in the middle. CEOs face real consequences. Boards are protected by limited liability. Employees are too small to prosecute.

---

## Part 2: Dictatorships and Autocracies

### 2.1 Dictator vs Military

Every dictator faces the same problem: they need the military to stay in power, but the military could remove them.

**General's Balance Sheet: Stay Loyal**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary, patronage, status) | $5M/year |
| **Receivable** (safety for self and family) | $20M NPV |
| **Exposure** (purged despite loyalty) | 10% × -$30M = -$3M |
| **Net Value** | **$22M** |

**General's Balance Sheet: Join Coup**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (if successful: power, wealth) | $200M |
| **Contingent Liability** (60% coup fails: execution) | -$50M |
| **Net Value** | **$170M** |

If these numbers held, every general would coup. Dictators survive by changing the balance sheet.

#### Coup-Proofing Strategies

**1. Raise Loyal Receivable**
- Pay military extremely well
- Patronage networks, luxury goods, property
- Create economic interests tied to regime survival
- Example: Saudi Arabia's officer corps has massive salaries, housing, privileges

**2. Lower Coup Receivable**
- Multiple competing security services (Army vs. Republican Guard vs. Secret Police)
- Ethnic/tribal recruitment to prevent coordination
- Rotate commanders frequently
- Example: Saddam's Iraq had 5+ overlapping security services

**3. Raise Coup Contingent Liability**
- Increase probability of failure through fragmentation
- Make consequences of failure horrific (execute families)
- Create mutual surveillance
- Example: North Korea's overlapping intelligence agencies all spy on each other

**4. Create Mutual Exposure**
- Implicate officers in regime crimes
- Corruption as loyalty mechanism (everyone has dirt on everyone)
- Example: Assad's military is bound by collective guilt for atrocities

**Revised General's Balance Sheet (in well-coup-proofed regime)**

| Option | Receivable | Liability | Net |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----|
| Stay loyal | $25M (high pay) + $20M (safety) | -$1M (5% purge risk) | **$44M** |
| Join coup | $200M | 90% fail × -$100M = -$90M | **$110M** |

Still favors coup! Dictators must push further:

| Option | Receivable | Liability | Net |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----|
| Stay loyal | $50M + $20M | -$1M | **$69M** |
| Join coup | $200M | 95% fail × -$200M = -$190M | **$10M** |

Now loyalty dominates. This is the Saudi/Gulf model: pay so well, and make coups so likely to fail, that no rational general defects.

#### Real-World Close Calls

**Soviet Union 1991**: The August coup failed because the plotters couldn't coordinate military units. Different commanders calculated different balance sheets. Some saw the contingent liability of joining as too high (which side would win?). The uncertainty itself prevented coordination.

**Turkey 2016**: Erdogan survived because:
1. Coup faction was small (coordination failure)
2. Public resistance raised failure probability
3. Technology allowed rapid counter-mobilization
4. Loyal units' balance sheets hadn't changed

Post-coup, Erdogan purged massively—raising the *exposure* of loyalty (you might be purged even if innocent), which temporarily made some officers' balance sheets favor defection. He had to quickly demonstrate that loyal officers were safe.

**Egypt 2011**: Military's balance sheet shifted. Mubarak's regime was weakening (lowering receivables for loyalty). The coup contingent liability dropped as protests grew (higher probability of success). Military calculated that removing Mubarak while preserving military privileges was optimal. They defected surgically.

---

### 2.2 Dictator vs Regional Governors

Dictators can't run everything. They must delegate to regional authorities.

**Governor's Balance Sheet: Administer Faithfully**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary, official benefits) | $500K/year |
| **Receivable** (future promotion) | $2M NPV |
| **Exposure** (blamed for regional problems) | -$300K |
| **Net Value** | **$2.2M** |

**Governor's Balance Sheet: Build Local Power Base**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (corruption proceeds) | $10M/year |
| **Receivable** (local autonomy, patron status) | $5M |
| **Contingent Liability** (30% purged: prison, death) | -$10M |
| **Net Value** | **$5M** |

Building a local power base often wins. Hence: warlordism, regional corruption, and state fragmentation.

#### The Information Problem

The dictator's core challenge is **information asymmetry**. The governor knows local conditions; the center doesn't.

| Information Source | Governor's Control | Reliability |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Official reports | Total | Low |
| Local party officials | High | Low-Medium |
| Secret police | Medium | Medium |
| Citizen complaints | Low | Medium-High |
| Purged officials' testimony | None | High (but biased) |

Dictators use multiple information channels to reduce governor advantage. But each channel has its own balance sheet (secret police can be bribed, citizen complaints can be fabricated).

#### The Chinese Communist Party Model

China's approach to the governor problem:

1. **Rotation**: Governors serve limited terms, then move
   - Reduces time to build local power base (lowers defection receivable)
   - Prevents local relationships from deepening

2. **Parallel hierarchies**: Party secretary vs. Governor
   - Each monitors the other
   - Both report to center through different channels

3. **Performance metrics**: GDP growth, stability indicators
   - Provides objective(ish) evaluation
   - Reduces information asymmetry

4. **Anti-corruption campaigns**: Periodic purges
   - Raises contingent liability for corruption
   - But also raises exposure for loyalty (might be purged anyway)

**Xi Jinping's innovation**: Massive anti-corruption campaign raised contingent liability so high that many officials stopped doing anything (to avoid creating evidence). This produced policy paralysis, requiring Xi to then *lower* contingent liability for good-faith execution errors.

---

### 2.3 The Dictator's Own Balance Sheet

Dictators face their own delegation problem: they delegated *from* someone (the previous elite, a revolutionary movement, the military that brought them to power).

**Dictator's Balance Sheet: Rule Moderately**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (power, wealth, status) | $500M |
| **Exposure** (natural death in office) | Low |
| **Exposure** (coup by restrained elite) | -$100M (20% × $500M) |
| **Net Value** | **$400M** |

**Dictator's Balance Sheet: Consolidate Totally**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (absolute power, unlimited extraction) | $2B |
| **Contingent Liability** (elite backlash during consolidation) | -$300M (30% × $1B) |
| **Net Value** | **$1.7B** |

Total consolidation often wins, which is why many dictators progressively eliminate constraints. But the transition period is dangerous.

#### The Succession Problem

The hardest balance sheet for a dictator: retirement.

**Retire Voluntarily**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (peaceful retirement, legacy) | $100M |
| **Exposure** (successor prosecutes you) | 40% × -$500M = -$200M |
| **Net Value** | **-$100M** |

**Rule Until Death**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (continued power) | $50M/year |
| **Contingent Liability** (coup, revolution) | Increases with age/weakness |
| **Net Value** | Positive until very old |

Voluntary retirement has *negative* expected value because successors often prosecute. This explains:
- Why dictators rule until death
- Why democratic transitions are so hard
- Why immunity deals are important for transitions

#### Real-World Applications

**Pinochet (Chile)**: Negotiated immunity, stepped down, later faced prosecution anyway. His balance sheet calculation was wrong—he underestimated contingent liability of retirement.

**Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore)**: Created a system where his family's interests were legally protected, successor was his son's generation. Managed the succession balance sheet unusually well.

**Putin (Russia)**: Has been managing this problem since 2008. The "castling" with Medvedev, constitutional changes extending terms, and now potential lifetime rule all reflect the negative expected value of retirement.

## Part 3: Democratic Systems

### 3.1 President vs Legislature

Democracies delegate executive power to presidents/prime ministers, with legislatures as oversight.

**President's Balance Sheet: Execute Laws Faithfully**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary, pension, legacy) | $10M NPV |
| **Receivable** (historical reputation) | $50M NPV (subjective) |
| **Exposure** (blamed for problems not your fault) | -$10M |
| **Net Value** | **$50M** |

**President's Balance Sheet: Expand Executive Power**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (more policy control, bypass opposition) | $30M |
| **Receivable** (help allies, hurt enemies) | $20M |
| **Contingent Liability** (impeachment) | P(impeach) × -$100M |
| **Contingent Liability** (electoral backlash) | P(lose) × -$30M |
| **Contingent Liability** (historical condemnation) | P(condemned) × -$50M |
| **Net Value** | Depends heavily on P(impeach) |

**The key variable is P(impeachment)**:

| Scenario | P(Impeach) | Power Grab Net Value |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Unified government, loyal party | 5% | $40M |
| Divided government, independent legislators | 60% | -$20M |
| Polarized, party-over-country | 10% | $35M |

**Insight**: Presidential self-restraint depends on impeachment being credible. Partisan polarization destroys this by making legislators calculate that protecting their president beats protecting the institution.

#### The Legislator's Balance Sheet

Why would a legislator *not* impeach a president who deserves it?

**Legislator's Balance Sheet: Vote to Impeach Own-Party President**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (institutional integrity, legacy) | $1M |
| **Contingent Liability** (primaried by own party, lose seat) | 70% × -$5M = -$3.5M |
| **Net Value** | **-$2.5M** |

**Legislator's Balance Sheet: Protect Own-Party President**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (keep seat, party support) | $3M |
| **Exposure** (reputation if president is later condemned) | -$500K |
| **Net Value** | **$2.5M** |

Protection wins. The individual legislator's balance sheet is misaligned with institutional health.

#### Real-World Applications

**Nixon (1974)**: Republican legislators' balance sheets shifted when the smoking gun tape emerged. P(Nixon guilty) went to ~100%, which flipped P(electoral backlash for protection) high enough to change calculations. They told Nixon he'd be convicted.

**Trump (2019-2021)**: Republican legislators' balance sheets heavily favored protection. P(primaried for voting to convict) was high. P(electoral backlash for protection) was low in gerrymandered districts. Only a few senators in safe seats or retiring could afford to vote their institutional interests.

**Brazil (2016)**: Dilma Rousseff impeached when her coalition collapsed. Legislators calculated that associating with her falling government was more costly than impeachment. Her contingent liability for supporting legislators had collapsed; she couldn't help them anymore.

---

### 3.2 Regulatory Capture

Regulatory agencies are delegated authority to oversee industries. The regulator has a balance sheet.

**Regulator's Balance Sheet: Regulate Faithfully**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary) | $180K/year |
| **Receivable** (public service satisfaction) | $50K/year (subjective) |
| **Receivable** (modest post-government career) | $500K NPV |
| **Exposure** (industry hostility, limited options) | -$200K |
| **Net Value** | **$1.5M** over career |

**Regulator's Balance Sheet: Serve Industry**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (lucrative post-government job) | $3M NPV |
| **Receivable** (industry goodwill, speaking fees) | $500K |
| **Contingent Liability** (exposed as captured) | 5% × -$1M = -$50K |
| **Net Value** | **$3.45M** over career |

Capture wins by a lot. The contingent liability is tiny because:
- Capture is hard to prove (just "industry-friendly views")
- Enforcement against regulators is rare
- The revolving door is normalized

#### Mechanisms That Change the Balance Sheet

**Raise contingent liability:**
- Cooling-off periods before industry employment
- Public disclosure of meetings with industry
- Strong inspector general offices
- Media scrutiny and NGO monitoring

**Raise faithful receivable:**
- Higher government salaries
- Prestige and recognition for tough regulators
- Clear career paths within government
- Post-government fellowships at universities/nonprofits

#### Real-World Applications

**FAA and Boeing**: FAA delegated certification authority to Boeing itself. Boeing employees were evaluating Boeing planes. Their balance sheets:
- Faithful: career at FAA/Boeing, salary
- Capture: career advancement at Boeing, don't rock the boat
- Contingent liability: almost zero (who would know?)

Result: 737 MAX was certified despite known issues.

**SEC Pre-2008**: Securities regulators' balance sheets heavily favored capture. Revolving door to Wall Street was the norm. Contingent liability for missing fraud was low (complexity provided cover). Bernie Madoff operated for decades.

**EPA Under Different Administrations**: Same agency, wildly different behavior. Why? Political appointees change the *internal* balance sheet for career staff. Under hostile administration, faithful regulation means career risk.

---

### 3.3 Judicial Independence

Judges are delegated the power to interpret law. Their balance sheet determines whether they're independent.

**Judge's Balance Sheet: Rule According to Law**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (salary, life tenure) | $5M NPV |
| **Receivable** (reputation, legal legacy) | $10M NPV (subjective) |
| **Exposure** (unpopular decisions, criticism) | -$1M |
| **Net Value** | **$14M** |

**Judge's Balance Sheet: Rule to Please Appointers**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (political favor, potential promotion) | $3M |
| **Contingent Liability** (reputation as hack, reversal on appeal) | 30% × -$5M = -$1.5M |
| **Net Value** | **$1.5M** |

With life tenure, independence wins. The institutional design raises the "rule according to law" receivable (security) while limiting the "please appointers" receivable (you already have the job).

#### When Judicial Independence Fails

**No life tenure:**

| Judge's Options (elected/short-term) | Net Value |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Rule according to law | $2M (no long-term security) |
| Please those who appoint/elect | $3M (reappointment, electoral support) |

Elected judges in the US show measurable bias toward popular decisions before elections.

**Court-packing threats:**

| Judge's Options (under packing threat) | Net Value |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Rule according to law | $3M (but court's power may be diluted) |
| Accommodate political pressure | $4M (preserve court's relevance) |

FDR's court-packing threat in 1937 changed the Supreme Court's behavior ("the switch in time that saved nine"). Justices calculated that institutional preservation required accommodation.

#### Real-World Applications

**Poland (2015-present)**: PiS government changed judicial balance sheets by:
- Lowering retirement age (removing judges)
- Creating disciplinary chamber (raising contingent liability for independent rulings)
- Packing constitutional tribunal

Judges now calculate: rule independently → risk career. Institutional independence collapses.

**Hungary**: Orbán's approach—pack the court, change jurisdictions, make the "independent" option costly enough that rational judges comply or leave.

---

## Part 4: Special Cases

### 4.1 Mutual Assured Exposure

In some systems, stability comes from *everyone* having leverage over *everyone*.

**Example: Corrupt Equilibrium**

In a thoroughly corrupt government, each official's balance sheet:

**Defect (expose others' corruption):**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (destroy rivals) | $10M |
| **Contingent Liability** (they expose you back) | 95% × -$20M = -$19M |
| **Net Value** | **-$9M** |

**Stay in Corrupt Equilibrium:**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (continued corruption proceeds) | $5M/year |
| **Exposure** (external investigation) | -$500K |
| **Net Value** | **$4.5M/year** |

Mutual exposure creates stability. Everyone is compromised, so no one can defect without being destroyed.

#### Breaking Mutual Exposure

**External actor**: Someone with nothing to lose (journalist, foreign prosecutor, new political outsider) has no contingent liability from exposing corruption.

**Immunity deals**: If one corrupt actor can get immunity, their balance sheet flips—they should defect and expose everyone else.

**Preference cascade**: If enough people defect simultaneously, the "expose you back" contingent liability becomes meaningless (everyone's already exposed). This is why corruption collapses suddenly rather than gradually.

#### Real-World Applications

**Italy's Tangentopoli (1992)**: A single judge's investigation started a cascade. Once some officials cooperated with immunity deals, others' balance sheets flipped—better to confess than be exposed. The entire First Republic collapsed.

**Ukraine's Maidan (2014)**: Yanukovych's regime was a mutual-exposure equilibrium. When external pressure (EU/Russia) destabilized the equilibrium, officials started calculating that the regime might fall. The cascade was rapid.

---

### 4.2 The Coordination Problem in Defection

Many defections require coordination—you can't coup alone, you can't capture a regulator alone, you can't impeach without votes.

**Individual's Balance Sheet for Coordinated Defection:**

| | Value |
|---|------|
| **Receivable** (if coordination succeeds) | $X |
| **Contingent Liability** (if coordination fails: you're exposed as disloyal) | -$Y |
| **Net Value** | P(coordinate) × $X + (1-P(coordinate)) × -$Y |

The key variable is P(coordinate)—will others join?

This creates **multiple equilibria**:

| Scenario | P(coordinate) | Individual Action |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Everyone expects failure | Low | Don't join → coordination fails |
| Everyone expects success | High | Join → coordination succeeds |

**Insight**: Stable regimes aren't necessarily popular. They're regimes where everyone expects coordination to fail, so no one tries.

#### Mechanisms That Prevent Coordination

**Communication disruption**: Can't coordinate if you can't communicate. Authoritarian control of media/communications raises coordination cost.

**First-mover punishment**: If the first person to defect is punished severely (and others don't join), everyone waits for someone else to go first.

**Loyalty signaling**: If everyone must publicly proclaim loyalty, it's harder to identify potential co-conspirators.

#### Real-World Applications

**Arab Spring**: Coordination problem solved by:
- Social media enabled communication
- Tunisia's success raised P(coordinate) elsewhere
- Each country's success raised others' P(coordinate)

The cascade happened because success updated everyone's beliefs about coordination probability.

**Belarus 2020**: Massive protests, but coordination for elite defection failed. Security services calculated that coordination among themselves was unlikely (Lukashenko had fragmented them). No one wanted to be the first to defect without assurance others would follow.

**Soviet Coup 1991**: The coup *almost* succeeded, but then a few units defected to Yeltsin. Once some defected, others' P(coordination for counter-coup) rose. The cascade went against the putschists.

---

### 4.3 Delegation Under Uncertainty

So far we've assumed everyone knows the probabilities. But in power struggles, probabilities themselves are contested.

**Different Beliefs, Different Balance Sheets:**

| Actor | Believes P(coup succeeds) | Coup Net Value |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| General A | 30% | Negative → stay loyal |
| General B | 60% | Positive → join coup |
| General C | 50% | Borderline → wait and see |

The dictator's job isn't just to make coups fail—it's to make everyone *believe* coups will fail.

**Propaganda as Balance Sheet Manipulation:**

| Message | Effect on Beliefs |
|---------|-------------------|
| "The military is loyal" | Lower P(coordination) |
| "Security services know everything" | Raise P(defection detected) |
| "The economy is strong" | Lower P(popular support for change) |
| "Enemies are everywhere" | Raise P(you'll be suspected anyway) |

#### The Fog of Power Struggle

During actual crises, uncertainty spikes. No one knows:
- How many others are defecting
- Whether security services are loyal
- Whether the leader is still in control
- What foreign actors will do

**This is when balance sheets flip rapidly.** Small signals update beliefs, which update balance sheets, which change behavior, which sends signals, which updates beliefs...

#### Real-World Applications

**Venezuela (2019)**: Guaidó declared himself president, expecting military defection. Key officers' balance sheets depended on believing others would join. When early defections were small, P(coordination) dropped, and most officers stayed loyal. Beliefs about others' behavior became self-fulfilling.

**Myanmar (2021)**: Military calculated that P(successful coup) was high because:
- They controlled coercive power
- Aung San Suu Kyi's government was weak
- International intervention unlikely

They were right about taking power, but wrong about governing—the subsequent resistance shows they miscalculated the *stability* balance sheet.

## Part 5: Implications and Design Principles

### 5.1 Why Oversight Works (When It Does)

Oversight works by raising the **contingent liability** of defection. Effective oversight makes potential defectors calculate that they're likely to be caught and punished.

**Components of Effective Oversight:**

| Component | Effect on Balance Sheet |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Detection capability | Raises P(caught) |
| Credible punishment | Raises Damage(if caught) |
| Independence | Prevents capture of oversight itself |
| Transparency | Enables external verification |

**The Oversight Balance Sheet:**

Oversight bodies face their own delegation problem. The overseer must have:
- High receivable for faithful oversight
- Low exposure for making unpopular findings
- Protections that raise their own defection contingent liability

If the overseer's balance sheet favors defection (capture, looking the other way), oversight fails.

### 5.2 Why Constitutional Design Matters

Constitutions are **balance sheet engineering at scale**. They try to set up delegation relationships where:

1. Each actor's "loyal" option dominates "defect"
2. Even if one actor defects, others' balance sheets make them check the defector
3. The system is robust to some actors having bad balance sheets

**Separation of Powers as Mutual Checking:**

| Branch | Their "Power Grab" | Checked By |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Executive | Exceed statutory authority | Courts reverse, Legislature defunds |
| Legislature | Pass unconstitutional laws | Courts strike down, Executive ignores |
| Courts | Judicial activism | Executive ignores, Legislature jurisdiction-strips |

Each branch's defection raises contingent liability because other branches benefit from stopping it.

**When Separation Fails:**

- Partisan alignment across branches (no benefit from checking own party)
- Norm erosion (defections go unpunished, lowering contingent liability for future defections)
- Emergency powers (normal balance sheets suspended)
- Asymmetric power (one branch can punish others but not vice versa)

### 5.3 Designing Stable Delegations

Based on this analysis, stable delegation requires:

**1. Make loyal option attractive**
- Adequate compensation
- Job security
- Status and recognition
- Future opportunities

**2. Make defection unattractive**
- High probability of detection
- Severe consequences if caught
- Swift and certain punishment
- Social/reputational costs

**3. Prevent coordination for collective defection**
- Multiple overlapping agents
- Agents with conflicting interests
- Communication monitoring (in authoritarian contexts)
- Rewards for reporting others' defection

**4. Maintain information flow**
- Multiple reporting channels
- Protection for whistleblowers
- Independent verification
- Prevent information monopolies

**5. Build in uncertainty about defection success**
- Don't let any single actor know if defection would succeed
- Maintain ambiguity about others' loyalties
- Preserve the ability to punish defection even if it temporarily succeeds

## Summary: The Universal Logic of Power Struggles

Every power struggle—corporate, political, military, regulatory—follows the same logic:

```
Net Value(Defect) vs. Net Value(Loyal)

where:
  Net Value(Defect) = Receivable(defect) - P(fail) × Damage(fail)
  Net Value(Loyal) = Receivable(loyal) - P(bad outcome anyway) × Damage(bad outcome)
```

**Power grabs happen when:**
- Receivable(defect) rises (more to gain from defection)
- P(fail) falls (defection seems likely to succeed)
- Damage(fail) falls (punishment becomes less credible)
- Receivable(loyal) falls (less reward for faithfulness)
- P(bad outcome anyway) rises (loyalty doesn't protect you)

**Stable systems maintain:**
- High receivable(loyal) through compensation, status, security
- High P(fail) through oversight, checks and balances, uncertainty
- High damage(fail) through credible punishment mechanisms
- Low P(bad outcome anyway) by protecting faithful agents

The framework doesn't tell us what *should* happen. It tells us what each actor is *calculating*—and therefore what interventions might change behavior.
