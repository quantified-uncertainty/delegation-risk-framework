# Theoretical Foundations

:::note[Theoretical Content]
These documents explore the mathematical and economic foundations of delegation risk. They provide formal frameworks that underpin the practical applications in other sections.

**Note on terminology**: These pages use "risk" (as in Delegation Risk) and "trust" somewhat interchangeably. Higher trust in a delegate means lower risk from that delegation. The framework is fundamentally about managing risk, but trust is a useful complementary concept.

## Documents

:::tip[Core Framework Theory]
For the foundational concepts (Agency, Power, Authority, Strong Tools), see the [Framework section](/delegation-risk/) which contains the core theoretical contributions alongside the risk formalization.

## Relationship to Practice

These theoretical foundations inform:

- **Protocol multipliers** in the [Protocol Catalog](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/protocol-catalog/)
- **Track record calculations** in the [Insurance Bot](/case-studies/anomaly-chronicles/insurance-bot-spec/)
- **Exposure modeling** in [Delegation Accounting](/delegation-risk/delegation-accounting/)
