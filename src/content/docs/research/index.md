description: Theoretical foundations and background research for those who want to understand the framework's underpinnings.
---

This section is for researchers, skeptics, and anyone who wants to understand *why* the framework works, not just *how* to apply it.

## Who This Section Is For

- **Researchers** validating the framework's foundations
- **Skeptics** wanting to see the theoretical backing
- **Builders** needing to extend the framework for novel situations
- **Academics** connecting this to existing literature

**Not for you if**: You just want to apply the framework. Start with [Getting Started](/getting-started/) and [Design Patterns](/design-patterns/) instead.

## Two Tracks

### Theoretical Foundations
Mathematical and economic models underlying the framework:

| Topic | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| [Trust Dynamics](/research/theory/trust-dynamics/) | How does trust evolve over time? |
| [Trust Accounting](/research/theory/trust-accounting/) | How do we track trust like finances? |
| [Trust Economics](/research/theory/trust-economics/) | What are the incentives and markets? |
| [Trust at Scale](/research/theory/trust-at-scale/) | How does trust compose in large systems? |
| [Trust Optimization](/research/theory/trust-optimization/) | How do we minimize risk? |
| [Trust Interfaces](/research/theory/trust-interfaces/) | How do components exchange trust? |
| [Trust Propagation](/research/theory/trust-propagation/) | How does risk flow through networks? |
| [Trust Protocols](/research/theory/trust-protocols/) | What are the formal handshakes? |
| [Human-AI Trust](/research/theory/human-ai-trust/) | How do humans and AI build trust? |

**Reading order**: Start with [Trust Dynamics](/research/theory/trust-dynamics/), then [Trust Economics](/research/theory/trust-economics/), then explore based on interest.

### Background Research
Domain knowledge that informed the framework:

| Category | Topics |
|----------|--------|
| **Domain Studies** | [Nuclear & Aerospace PRA](/research/nuclear-aerospace-deep-dive/), [Financial Risk Budgeting](/research/financial-risk-budgeting/) |
| **AI Safety** | [AI Safety Frameworks](/research/ai-safety-frameworks/), [Alignment Tax](/research/alignment-tax-quantification/), [Capability Elicitation](/research/capability-elicitation-sandbagging/), [Empirical Scheming](/research/empirical-scheming-reduction/) |
| **Technical** | [Formal Verification Limits](/research/formal-verification-limits/), [Runtime Monitoring](/research/runtime-monitoring-architectures/), [Steganography Detection](/research/steganography-detection-prevention/) |
| **Economic** | [Fidelity Insurance](/research/fidelity-insurance/), [Mechanism Design](/research/mechanism-design/) |
| **Mathematical** | [Compositional Risk](/research/compositional-risk-measures/), [Correlated Failures](/research/correlated-failure-modeling/), [Linear Logic](/research/linear-logic-trust-budgets/) |
| **Meta** | [Potential Projects](/research/potential-projects/), [Human Trust Calibration](/research/human-trust-calibration/) |

## Connection to Main Framework

The theoretical foundations connect to practical concepts:

| Theory Page | Informs | Practical Application |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| [Trust Dynamics](/research/theory/trust-dynamics/) | How trust changes | [Empirical Tests](/design-patterns/tools/empirical-tests/) |
| [Trust Propagation](/research/theory/trust-propagation/) | Risk flow | [Risk Inheritance Tool](/design-patterns/tools/trust-propagation/) |
| [Trust Economics](/research/theory/trust-economics/) | Incentive design | [Insurer's Dilemma](/delegation-risk/insurers-dilemma/) |
| [Fidelity Insurance](/research/fidelity-insurance/) | Pricing defection | [Delegation Accounting](/delegation-risk/delegation-accounting/) |

## Reading Suggestions

### Validate the Framework
If you're skeptical and want to check the foundations:
1. [Trust Dynamics](/research/theory/trust-dynamics/) — Is the trust model sound?
2. [Trust Economics](/research/theory/trust-economics/) — Do the incentives work?
3. [Fidelity Insurance](/research/fidelity-insurance/) — Is there real-world precedent?

### Extend the Framework
If you're building something the framework doesn't cover:
1. [Trust Interfaces](/research/theory/trust-interfaces/) — How to define new boundaries
2. [Compositional Risk](/research/compositional-risk-measures/) — How risk combines
3. [Potential Projects](/research/potential-projects/) — Open research questions

### Academic Context
If you want to connect to existing literature:
1. [AI Safety Frameworks](/research/ai-safety-frameworks/) — Related approaches
2. [Nuclear & Aerospace PRA](/research/nuclear-aerospace-deep-dive/) — Domain origins
3. [Formal Verification Limits](/research/formal-verification-limits/) — What formal methods can't do
