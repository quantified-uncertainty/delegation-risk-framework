This interactive visualization shows a complex delegation hierarchy for a coding task (implementing a new feature with authentication, API, and database components).

## Understanding the Visualization

### Node Types

| Icon | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 👤 | Human | Ultimate authority and oversight |
| 🎯 | Coordinator | Plans and routes tasks (high leverage) |
| 🤖 | Agent | Designs/analyzes but doesn't execute |
| ⚡ | Executor | Writes code or makes changes |
| ✓ | Verifier | Reviews and validates (read-only) |

### Risk Levels

Risk is determined by a combination of:
- **Permissions scope** (what can the node access/modify?)
- **Potential impact** (what's the blast radius of mistakes?)
- **Position in hierarchy** (can it influence other nodes?)

### Key Patterns to Notice

1. **Coordinator Risk**: The Task Planner has elevated risk despite limited permissions—its position gives it leverage over the entire system.

2. **Defense in Depth**: Security-critical paths (Auth Implementer) have dedicated verifiers (Security Reviewer).

3. **Permission Scoping**: Each executor has write access limited to specific directories, not the entire codebase.

4. **Read-Only Defaults**: Designers and verifiers have read-only access—they can influence decisions but can't directly cause harm.

5. **Isolated Low-Risk Tasks**: Documentation is handled by a separate low-risk executor outside the main task chain.

## Delegation Risk Calculation

The delegation risk values shown ($/month) represent the expected cost from potential failures:

```
Delegation Risk = Σ P(harm mode) × Damage(harm mode)
```

High-risk nodes like the Auth Implementer ($300/mo) have:
- Access to sensitive data (secrets, auth logic)
- Ability to introduce security vulnerabilities
- Higher probability of consequential mistakes

Low-risk nodes like the Doc Writer ($20/mo) have:
- Isolated scope (only /docs/)
- Limited blast radius
- Easy to verify and correct

## Try It Yourself

Explore the graph above to understand:
- Which nodes have the highest delegation risk?
- Where are the "choke points" where controls would be most effective?
- Which paths lead to the highest-impact components?
- How does the tree structure limit blast radius compared to a fully-connected system?
